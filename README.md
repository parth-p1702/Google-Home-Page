## Google Homepage Clone

Hi Reader!  

This was the first significant page I made using HTML and CSS, and it helped me understand the basics of these languages.
I cloned the Google homepage as precisely as I could, but there might be some minor discrepancies, especially across various browsers.
Even so, this was extremely fun and insightful, and if you haven't tried it yet, I encourage you to do so!
